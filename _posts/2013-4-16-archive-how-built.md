So what better way to kick off the real posts than to talk about how I actually put this blog together, and while I'm at it, I'll also talk a bit about the rest of the site.

All the magic going on behind the scenes was made possible by [PHP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP).  I use PHP to handle a lot of the dynamic stuff going on with the site and to make maintenance and expansion easier for me.  I have to thank [TutsPlus.com](http://tutsplus.com/) for their excellent tutorials on learning PHP (amongst hundreds of other topics.

To make the blog work, I have my site hooked up to a database where I store my posts.  Nothing fancy.  The part of this blog project that I'm most proud of is the CMS I made to create, edit, show and hide blog posts.  Unfortunately, I'll probably be the only person to see this backend :(. 

I'll definitely be adding more features to this CMS in the near future (easy formatting, photo management, etc), especially since I'll be taking a week-long school trip to Berlin!  Hopefully I'll have tons of photos and stories to share.

Oh, and here's my favorite internet cat, Lil Bub :)
