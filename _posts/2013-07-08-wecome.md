After putting a dozen hours into a remake of my old personal website using Hyde with Twitter Boostrap and Flat UI, I decided to jump ship and move over to the light side and use Jekyll with Foundation 4 and Compass.

[Here](https://github.com/joshclick/jekyll-foundation-compass) you can find a functional starter site that has these technologies integrated. It took me quite a while to figure how to get everything to work with each other in a friendly manner, which is why I made a repo for it.

Hopefully it'll save others some pain in the future =].  It'll also be nice to use for quickly starting sites for myself in the future.
