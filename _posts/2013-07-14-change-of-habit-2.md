In my previous post, I rambled a bit about wanting to change some of my habits.

Now it's time to talk about my plan!

I've read hundreds, maybe thousands of pages of self help books and their ilk, and this is one of the few times I get to actively apply what I've learned.

So first, some basic guidelines for changing habits:
- Gradual change is better
- Immediate change is better
- Set long term goals, short term goals, medium term goals
- Screw goals, just do it... Nike&trade;
- Record everything you do in a physical journal
- Use online tracking software to track your progress
- Buy a bunch of gadgets that will help you accomplish your goal
- Blah blah blah

So what gives, right? Advice from different sources will all say different things, but which is the right source to follow? Obviously the one with the most recognized name, right?

Nope.

My relatively few years in existence has taught me a few important lessons, one of which goes as follows:

> Everybody has a different way of doing things. Find what works for YOU. It may be completely different from another person, or completely the same! Take what you read with a grain of salt, and only treat it as a suggestion.

This applies to nearly everything.  Finding a career, founding a startup, building a startup, building a network, making friends, making love, losing weight or even changing habits.

So in this post, I'm going to go through what I think is the best way for myself.  It may or may not work for you.

### The Goals

I like goals. Here are my current goals:
- Go to sleep before 1am
- Wake up before 10am
- Get out of bed immediately, when my first alarm goes off
- No putting meals off for more than 2 hours
- Go to gym at least 3x/week
- I get 4 passes on any of these goals per month

I plan on starting immediately.  I suppose I'll post updates periodically or if anything significant happens.
