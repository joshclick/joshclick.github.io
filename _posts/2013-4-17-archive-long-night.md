I can't believe I did this to myself again.  No matter how many times I tell myself to go to sleep or to stop, I get hooked back into my computer.  Now its 8 AM.  I've been coding since midnight.  I'd like to say that this doesn't happen too often, but I can't.

The story usually goes like this:  I can't fall asleep for whatever reason.  I decide to hop onto the computer for a bit "just til i get tired," but of course, the light will keep me up longer.  So, in the end, I'll be deep within Reddit or working on a new project.  Usually, by 5 AM, I finally realize that at this rate, I won't be able to make it through class the next day, so I peel myself off my laptop and go to sleep.

Today, I kept on going.  Well I could never browse Reddit for 8 hours... at least I haven't done that (yet).  What I did end up spending my time on, as the title of this post implies, was completely rewriting my site using the <a href="http://cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a> framework.  The organization and management of my bootstrapped MVC framework was getting rather tedious, so I thought it worthwhile to move onto a real framework.

Cake is great!  I've read reviews and comparisons of all sorts of other frameworks and Cake seems to have the best balance of ease of use, performance and functionality, at least for me.

If I've succeeded in my coding spree, the site should function identically as it did before, but it will be much easier to expand and manage.  The only downside I've noticed from using Cake over plain, vanilla PHP is a rather significant drop in performance, which is expected.  The split second greater loading time, however, is a trivial sacrifice for cleaner code,  faster development, and additional built-in functionality
