My original motive behind starting this site was to practice "flat design." At the current iteration, the design is nowhere near flat.  Sure it's clean, but nothing like iOS 7 or Windows 8 Metro, or the UI of any other sites with those design philosophies.

The reason I wanted to make a site like that at all was to practice my design in general.  My reasoning behind doing that was to gain a sense of progress or achievement.

A week into this site, I'm not sure if I've really accomplished anything.  I did learn a little Ruby. I learned how to use Jekyll. I learned Compass. I learned SASS. I learned YAML. I learned GitHub Pages. I learned how to fail at using Heroku and AWS.

But...

What can I really gain from this experience?

As a "wantrepreneur," this site seems to have gotten me no closer to that "perfect idea," the idea that I'll turn into a massive company and have a great exit and be rich and happy.  Obviously, the point of being an entrepreneur shouldn't be to make money, but that's a topic for another rant.

This site is almost an excuse for progress, something I've tricked myself into thinking I'm being productive at all, whereas in reality, have I really gotten any closer to my goal?

After all, I can accomplish something similar just using tumblr, or even a plain notebook (like the Moleskine I'm afraid to write in).

When I really think about it, I'm just making this site to feel like I'm doing something useful, but in reality, I'm doing this since I can't think of anything else to do.

So...

What's next?
