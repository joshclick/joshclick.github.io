What am I looking for?  What are my goals in life? How am I going to achieve them?  Will I even achieve them?

Every now and then, I'll have an existential crisis.  I sit down by myself, and think.  I try, futily, to figure out what I'm doing with my life.  Sometimes, I reach a satisfactory conclusion, othertimes, I'm left even more lost than before.

Some of what I have figured out is this:
- I like coding.
- I like design.
- I like solving problems.
- I like having an impact.

What I can distill those previous conclusions down to, is essentially that I want to be noticed. I yearn to be admired, that person that everybody approaches after a presentation. I want to be a Tony Stark. I want to be a Superman. Hell, I'd even settle for a Batman.

The only thing stopping me is immense intelligence, physical ability, or wealth.

So, for tonight's crisis, have I come to any conclusions, any revelations?  Maybe not, but I do have something to write about.

P.S. I'm deciding now that I'm not writing for any audience. I'm writing these posts simply as a mind dump, something that I can look back upon in the future and see how I've developed.  Maybe also somewhere I can practice my writing, and learn to use the written word to properly formulate my thoughts.
