Bad habits die hard. Very true.

Actually all habits die hard, but its the bad ones that we really worry (or sometimes, not worry) about.

A few of mine:
- Going to sleep after 3am
- Waking up after 10 or 11am
- Lingering in bed for an hour or two after waking up
- Working until I'm absolutely starving and I can't go on, to eat
- Putting off working out for other "easier" work

I've already attempted several times to change these habits, but whether the change lasts a day, a week or even a few months, they tend to always come back.

Consistently following these poor habits is obviously bad for my health and they also negatively influence my productivity, both things that I value immensely.

So why am I writing about this here in the "public" realm?

I want to publically commit to changing these habits, and hopefully this will, not only make me stick to my commitments, but also serve as a guide or encouragement for others.

Perhaps I'm dramatizing my situation a bit much. I'm not looking to lose 100 pounds or stop smoking or prepare for a triathlon. I'm aiming for humble improvements, little changes that will add up over time.

In my next post, I'll talk about my plan of attack.
