Hello, my friends. If you haven't found out yet, my name is Joshua Qian, but I like to go by Josh Click; it's much simpler.

I recently became inspired to start blogging by the personal blogs of others. It seems like an excellent way to share my thoughts and to talk about progress in my various projects.  I have no clue what kind of blog this will eventually turn into though.  It could be super technical blog or a place where I dive into introspective self analysis.

Who knows... 

The path this takes will be fascinating to see.  Whatever happens, I hope to look back on these posts sometime in the future and think to myself, "hm.. i've done pretty well over the years..."
