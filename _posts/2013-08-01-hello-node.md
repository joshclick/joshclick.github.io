I'm not sure if I'm suffering from shiny object syndrome but I'm thinking about ditching Rails (for the moment) and creating a Node.js app, probably using the Express framework. Why? Learning it would be fun and it just *feels* like the right choice.

To me, Rails feels like a grandpa compared to Node.js. It's more experienced and more capable out of the box, but not quite as nimble as Node.

We'll see how this goes :)
