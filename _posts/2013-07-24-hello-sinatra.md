So what you see is the product of quite some laboring. I opted for a microframework so I could learn more about the ins and outs of ruby apps instead of having all of the magic of rails. Perhaps I'll "upgrade" sometime in the future.

Putting this together has taken a lot of effort though, to get all of the different components working nicely together, so I've put together a [skeleton site](https://github.com/joshclick/A-Sinatra-Blog).

I will be writing a how to guide about how I built all of this and how to deploy it to Heroku easily, since it was a bit of a challenge to find resources on how to put each part together. Hopefully it'll help others in the future as well :)

*Update: Learning Rails then moving the site to Rails. I'm awfully indecisive sometimes and the documentation and community for Rails is so much larger and more thorough. Sinatra, it's been a fun ride*
